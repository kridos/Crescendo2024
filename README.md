# FRC 2024 Crescendo Robot Control Code

## Project Overview

This repository contains the control system code for team 9450 (Velocity Raptors) competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Crescendo Season (2024). This is a forked repository, reflecting my contributions to the official team codebase. The codebase leverages the WPILib framework and Java programming to empower the robot with functionalities crucial for achieving competition success.

## Key Features & Functionalities

* **Game-Specific Optimization:** Code is meticulously designed to align with the specific game objectives of the Crescendo season, ensuring efficient task completion and maximizing scoring potential.

* **Advanced Sensor Integration:** Sensor data from vision cameras, encoders, laser sensors, and gyroscopes is seamlessly integrated for real-time feedback and complex decision-making within the control system.

* **High-Performance Control Systems:** Precise motor control algorithms optimize robot movement, enabling accurate and efficient execution of game-specific maneuvers.

* **Teleoperated Control with Operator Feedback:** Intuitive teleoperated control allows for skillful maneuvering and strategic gameplay execution, while integrated feedback mechanisms provide valuable information to the driver during operation.

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** The primary programming language for the control system.

* **WPILib:** The official FIRST Robotics Competition library, providing essential functionalities for robot control.

* **REVLib:** Used for controlling REV Robotics motor controllers.

* **CTRE Phoenix:** Used for controlling Cross The Road Electronics (CTRE) motor controllers.

## My Contributions

As a key contributor to this codebase, my work included:

* Developing and tuning **PID control loops** for precise control of both the **drivetrain and arm motors**.

* Contributing to the **positioning system** for the **multiple degree of freedom arm**, specifically developing and implementing the **mathematical models** for accurate joint control.

* Contributing to the modular design and documentation efforts to improve code maintainability.

## Team Principles

This codebase reflects the dedication and collaborative effort of our FRC team. We prioritize:

* **Strategic Development:** Code is strategically designed to align with the specific challenges and scoring opportunities presented by the Crescendo season game.

* **Modularity and Maintainability:** Code is structured for modularity and maintainability, facilitating efficient updates, troubleshooting, and future development.

* **Code Documentation:** Clear and concise comments document the codebase, enhancing readability and fostering understanding for current and future team members.

## Associated Team
* **FRC Team 9450 (Velocity Raptors)**

## Related Robotics Projects

I have also contributed to the control systems for my previous FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) teams during the Freight Frenzy (2022) and Power Play (2023) seasons. This work involved developing autonomous routines, integrating various sensors, and implementing motor control for competitive robotics.
